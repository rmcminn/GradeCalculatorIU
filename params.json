{"name":"IU GPA Calculator","tagline":"A GPA calculator for students of Indiana University - Bloomington","body":"####[Download](https://github.com/rmcminn/GradeCalculatorIU/releases/download/v1.0/GradeCalculatorIU.jar) - Latest Release\r\n\r\n###How To Install\r\nOnce you have the .jar downloaded, make sure you have the latest version of Java RunTime installed, then just double click on the .jar file, and you're ready to go.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nI'm the kind of guy that likes to know where my GPA stands for a current semester, and I found Indiana University's [web tool](http://registrar.indiana.edu/information/calculator.shtml) really tedious. So, I developed a desktop application that I could just run fast and easy.\r\n\r\n###GPA SCALE\r\nI use the official IU GPA scale, which you can view [here](http://registrar.indiana.edu/grades/grade-values/grading-system.shtml)\r\n```\r\nA  | 4.0\r\nA- | 3.7\r\nB+ | 3.3\r\nB  | 3.0\r\nB- | 2.7\r\nC+ | 2.3\r\nC  | 2.0\r\nC- | 1.7\r\nD+ | 1.3\r\nD  | 1.0\r\nD- | 0.7\r\nF  | 0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bugs, Issues, and Features?\r\nOccasionally, I do mess on up things and could use some help! If you find a problem with the application you can either post a new [issue](https://github.com/rmcminn/GradeCalculatorIU/issues?state=open) on GitHub, or just shoot me an email - mcminnra@gmail.com .
